This project combines the power of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) with AssemblyAI's transcription capabilities, enabling you to interact with audio recordings as if they were conversational text. By leveraging Qwen3-32b for natural language understanding, this solution efficiently retrieves and answers queries based on your audio content.

# üöÄ Features
- **Audio Transcription** using AssemblyAI for accurate speech-to-text conversion.
- **Qdrant Vector Database** for efficient retrieval and semantic search.
- **DeepSeek R1** via **SambaNova Cloud** for powerful language model responses.
- Seamless integration of transcription and **RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)** for improved context-aware conversations.

# üß† How It Works
1. **Transcription:** AssemblyAI transcribes your audio file, extracting speaker information for better clarity.
2. **Embedding Generation:** Text data is embedded using HuggingFace's `BAAI/bge-large-en-v1.5` model.
3. **Vector Search:** Qdrant's vector database efficiently retrieves relevant context from indexed data.
4. **RAG Model Response:** DeepSeek R1 generates accurate and context-aware responses based on retrieved content.

# **‚öôÔ∏è Installation**

## 1. **Install uv**:
```bash
# For macOS:
brew update
brew install uv

# For Windows - Open PowerShell as Administrator and run the below command:
powershell -ExecutionPolicy ByPass -c "irm https://astral.sh/uv/install.ps1 | iex"
```

# **üéØ Getting Started**

## 1. Clone the repository
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/karthikponna/chat_with_audios.git
   cd chat_with_audios
   ```
## 2. Install dependencies

First deactivate any active virtual environment

```bash
deactivate
```

To install the dependencies and activate the virtual environment, run the following command

```bash
uv venv .venv
uv sync
```

## 3. Environment Configuration

Before running any command, you have to set up your environment:
1. Create your environment file:
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```

Add AssemblyAI and Sambanova API keys in the .env file.

# üèóÔ∏è Set Up Your Local Infrastructure

We use Docker to set up the local infrastructure (Qdrant, Streamlit).

> [!WARNING]
> Before running the command below, ensure you do not have any processes running on port `6333` and `6334` (Qdrant) and `8501` (Streamlit).

To start the Docker infrastructure, run:
```bash
docker compose build
```

To stop the Docker infrastructure, run:
```bash
docker compose stop
```

# ‚ö°Ô∏è Running the Code

Run the below command to start the app:
```bash
docker compose up
```
